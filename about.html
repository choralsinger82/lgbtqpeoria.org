      <h1>About this project</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        LGBTQ Peoria is a local resource hub for Peoria and Central Illinois, starting with Rainbow Pages —
        a community-reviewed directory of affirming spaces.
      </p>
    </header>

      <h2>Inclusivity</h2>
      <p>
        We use “LGBTQ” as a widely recognized shorthand. This site explicitly includes lesbian, gay, bisexual,
        transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, aromantic, nonbinary, questioning, and gender-diverse people.
      </p>
      <p class="small muted">
        If language on the site can be improved, we want to hear that. This is meant to evolve with the community.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>About the Logo</h2>

      <p>
        This logo was created to honor Peoria, its LGBTQ community, and the history of the LGBTQ community as a whole.
        Care has been taken to be as inclusive as possible in the design of the logo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bridge is in the style of Peoria's Murray Baker Bridge, a hallmark of the Peoria skyline. The colors of the
        bridge's trusses reflect the original colors of the Pride flag designed by Gilbert Baker: hot pink, red, orange,
        yellow, green, turquoise, indigo, and violet. The colors of the deck of the bridge are taken from the
        Intersex-Inclusive Progress Pride Flag. Our community would not be complete without the inclusion of intersex
        and transgender people. We also would not be complete without our people of color.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three people in the center represent our joined community while the colors represent Peoria itself. The left
        person's browns represent the river bluffs and the golds represent the sandstone. The center person's greens
        represent our prairie and farmland and the blue represents our shared sky. The person on the right's charcoals
        represent downtown's buildings and roads with the gray representing Peoria's limestone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, no Peoria-based logo would be complete without the iconic river. The river was an important part of the
        lives of the Indigenous people who lived here before the area was colonized and settled. It was that same river
        that brought people here and continues to be an important part of trade and transportation today.
